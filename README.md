# Sphinx185
A [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) 
documentation helper, using the solution of 
[Problem 185 from Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=185) 
as a case study.

## How to use this for YOUR next project


You can start your onboarding with sphinx by browsing 
[the documentation of this repository](https://dalyag.github.io/Sphinx185/index.html),
that has this home page:

![Documentation Landing Page](../master/data/LandingPage.png)

At the button of every page, you can find the source code 
that will help you generate cool documentation for your own project!

To apply all this, you can use these instructions (also found 
[here](https://dalyag.github.io/Sphinx185/how_to_use_this_for_your_next_project.html)):
