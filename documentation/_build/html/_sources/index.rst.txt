   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Sphinx185's documentation!
=====================================
|

This documentation follows the solution of the 185th riddle from `Project Euler <https://projecteuler.net/problem=185>`_.

The goal of this piece is to help make `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ accessible and easy to use.

Feel as free as you can to copy, paste and change anything you see here.

The source code is available `here <https://github.com/DalyaG/Sphinx185>`_.

.. To make sure this is indeed colored pink, I added a .pinktext class to graphite.css

OK Let's get to business:

.. maxdepth = 1 means the Table of Contents will only links to the separate pages of the documentation.
   Increasing this number will result in deeper links to subtitles etc.

.. The following command allows me to chose line breaks inside a "note" environment.
   Outside a special environment, i could use
   | vertical bars
   | to format lines
   | to my desire

.. topic:: How to use this for YOUR next project:

    * ``pip install sphinx``

    * Option 1: from the terminal, run ``sphinx-quickstart`` from the directory of the repository you wish to document, |br|
      and follow the suggestions of your choice from this tutorial. |br|
      (My advice: install sphinx inside a dedicated documentation folder, to keep your project from clutter)

    * Option 2: copy-paste the documentation folder in this project, and edit the relevant ``.rst`` files.

    * On any case, the way to add pages to your documentation, is by:

      #. creating a ``.rst`` file for the function/module |br|
         you wish to document (you can use the templates supplied here), and

      #. add the name of the ``.rst`` file to the |br|
         ``toctree`` in ``index.rst`` (the source code for this page).

    * After editing the files, run ``make html`` from inside the folder in which you installed sphinx. |br|
      (**TIP OF THE DAY**: actually, run ``make clean html`` to clear the documentation cache and build from scratch)

    * Open the file ``documentation/_build/html/index.html`` in your browser, and enjoy the read :)

.. topic:: Tiny disclaimer:

    As I enjoy Project Euler greatly, I was hesitant to publish my solution online.

    Yet, since I saw many similar solutions are already available, I decided the educational
    cause of this tutorial justifies the means.

    So all you Euler buddies out there - hope you share my view :)
