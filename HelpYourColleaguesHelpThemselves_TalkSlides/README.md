# Help your colleagues help themselves - a Sphinx tutorial

In this folder you can find the slides for my talk from PyCon Israel 2018.

Soon I will also post here a link for the video, if such will exist :)

There is also a commented version of the slides, for the hearing impaired, 
and for those who prefer the writen word.

There are are also "Extra Slides" of parts of the talk that were edited out,
but I still thought could be of use.

Hope you find all this useful, 
and keep sharing the knowledge!
