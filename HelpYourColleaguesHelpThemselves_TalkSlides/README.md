# Help your colleagues help themselves - a Sphinx tutorial

In this folder you can find the slides for my talk from PyCon Israel 2018.

You can watch the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OAAL78PES8).

There is also a **commented version** of the slides, for the hearing impaired,
and for those who prefer the written word.

There are are also **Extra Slides** of parts of the talk that were edited out,
but I still thought could be of use.

Hope you find all this useful, 
and keep sharing the knowledge!
