The ILP Manager class
=====================

ILP Formulation
***************
|

This class models Euler's 185th riddle with the following Integer Linear Problem:

 Let :math:`\left\{ x_{i,c}\right\} _{i\in[m],c\in[10]}` be binary variables indicating \
 the color of the digits in :math:`s^{*}`, that is: \
 :math:`x_{j,c}=1\thinspace\thinspace\iff\thinspace\thinspace v_{j}^{*}=c`.

 Since each vertex in :math:`s^{*}` has only one color, we get the constraints: \
 :math:`\left\{ \sum_{c=0}^{9}x_{j,c}=1\right\} _{j\in[m]}`

 And from the input of correct vertices we get the constraints: \
 :math:`\left\{ \sum_{j\in[m]}x_{j,v_{j}^{\left(i\right)}}=d^{\left(i\right)}\right\} _{i\in[n]}`

 Since we are guarantied that only one solution exists, we can put a dummy objective function of our choice, \
 and solve the ILP to get the unique solution.

.. Notice the markers line is longer than the headline.
.. It is allowed. but markers lines shorter than headlines are not allowed.
..
   Notice further: each time you change the type of heading marker
   (here we started with =, then * then #)
   The heading level drops (heading 1 => heading 2 => etc.)
