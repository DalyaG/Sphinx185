Welcome to Sphinx185's documentation!
=====================================
|

This documentation follows the solution of the 185th riddle from `Project Euler <https://projecteuler.net/problem=185>`_.

The goal of this project is to help make `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ accessible and easy to use.

To use this for YOUR next project, browse this documentation and follow the instructions :doc:`here <how_to_use_this_for_your_next_project>`.

Feel as free as you can to copy, paste and change anything you see here.

The source code is available `here <https://github.com/DalyaG/Sphinx185>`_.

.. To make sure this is indeed colored pink, I added a .pinktext class to graphite.css

.. topic:: Tiny disclaimer:

    As I enjoy Project Euler greatly, I was hesitant to publish my solution online.

    Yet, since I saw many similar solutions are already available, I decided the educational
    cause of this tutorial justifies the means.

    So all you Euler buddies out there - hope you share my view :)
